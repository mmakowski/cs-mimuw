An unsuccesful attempt to implement DES encryption and decryption routiones in assembly -- the final laboratory assignment for Computer Architecture and Low-Level Programming course. 
There have been some smaller, intermediate assignments as well (I remember the Sieve of Eratosthenes), but I've lost the code.
