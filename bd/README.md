Test solutions and final project from databases course. The project consisted of a
database running on Oracle (must have been 8i at the time), web-based client UI written in 
php and admin UI written in Oracle*Forms. I remember that setting up Oracle on my home
PC was a royal PITA -- I think I tried both Linux and Windows versions and settled on
the latter. A couple of years later I even lent my massive tower PC for a week or so to a 
friend who was doing the same course, to save him going through the pain of installing Oracle.

Oracle*Forms was a rubbish environment, as far as I recall, coding in it wasn't fun at all. Oh, and clearly noone told us anything about webapp security; witness clear-text passwords stored in the DB and awkward system of recognising the logged-in user.

I quite enjoyed the course though, mostly for lecturer's wry sense of humour; for a good example  check out `las.insert` at the [Oracle*Forms example page](http://stencel.mimuw.edu.pl/bd/Oracle-Forms/)
