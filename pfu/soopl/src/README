This directory contains the 0.1.2 release of soopl interpreter.

soopl is a Simple Object-Oriented Programming language. The
interpreter is written in SML and requires MoscowML
(http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html).

This is an early version of soopl, so changes in language syntax and
semantics are to be expected; backward compatibility WILL NOT be retained.


Installation
------------

To run soopl programs, run the mosml, load the SOOPL.sml file: 

use "SOOPL.sml"; 

and type:

SOOPL.run <progtext>;

where <progtext> is a string containing soopl program code.
