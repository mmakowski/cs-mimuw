The course project was to write a turn-based strategy game where the objective was
to catch stray dinsaurs using a range of equipment and personnel. The rules were 
described in detail and apparently, judging from the contents of `doc` directory,
 there was a requirement to design the class hierarchy and interactions upfront.

I remember this being a fairly big project, but also having a lot of fun with it --
not the least due to awesomeness of Smalltalk. Requires [Dolphin Smalltalk](http://www.object-arts.com/products/dce.html).
